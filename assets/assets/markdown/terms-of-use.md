### Ohana Sports Terms of Use

**Effective Date:** July 2nd, 2025

Welcome to Ohana Sports! These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Ohana Sports mobile app, website, and related services (collectively, the “Service”). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service. Please read them carefully.

#### 1. Who We Are
“Ohana Sports,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to Ohana Sports Tech LLC, a company based in Seattle, Washington. Our mission is to empower athletes and coaches through technology that enhances training, team coordination, and performance tracking.

#### 2. Using Our Service
You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. If you are under 18, you may only use the Service under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian.
You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in compliance with these Terms, any applicable laws, and community guidelines that we may publish.

#### 3. Your Account
You may need an account to use parts of the Service. You’re responsible for safeguarding your account credentials and all activities that occur under your account.
You agree to provide accurate and complete information when creating your account and to keep it updated.

#### 4. Subscriptions and Payments
Some features of the Service may require payment or a subscription. If you subscribe, you agree to the terms of that subscription, including billing and renewal. We’ll always make the pricing and billing terms clear before you commit.
You can cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings, but refunds are only available as required by law.

#### 5. Hardware and Third-Party Products
If you purchase hardware or integrate third-party products with the Ohana Sports platform, additional terms may apply. We’re not responsible for third-party hardware or services unless we explicitly say so.

#### 6. Your Content
You may upload or submit data, comments, or other materials (“User Content”) through the Service. You retain ownership of your User Content, but you grant Ohana Sports a license to use, store, display, and share it as needed to operate the Service.
You must not post or submit anything illegal, harmful, offensive, or that violates someone else’s rights.

**6.1 Shared Drills and Playlists**

The Service allows users to share custom drills or playlists with others via a public link. When you choose to share a drill or playlist, the content and associated data become accessible to anyone with that link.

You are responsible for any data included in a shared drill or playlist, including text, titles, comments, and performance data. Shared content should not include personal or confidential information you do not wish to make public. You may revoke access at any time by marking a drill or playlist as private within the App. Once made private again, the shared link will no longer be publicly accessible.

#### 7. Our Content and Technology
All rights to the Ohana Sports software, visuals, trademarks, and other content are owned by us or our licensors. You agree not to copy, modify, reverse engineer, or use any of our materials in unauthorized ways.

#### 8. Changes to the Service
We’re constantly improving. That means we may add, change, or remove features at any time. We’ll do our best to notify you if major changes affect your use of the Service.

#### 9. Termination
We may suspend or terminate your account or access to the Service if you violate these Terms or use the Service in harmful or illegal ways. You can also stop using the Service at any time.

#### 10. Disclaimers
We provide the Service “as is.” We don’t guarantee that it will always be safe, secure, or error-free. Use it at your own risk. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties.

#### 11. Limitation of Liability
To the fullest extent allowed by law, Ohana Sports and its affiliates won’t be liable for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of your use of the Service.

#### 12. Disputes and Governing Law
These Terms are governed by the laws of Washington State. Any disputes will be resolved in the state or federal courts located in King County, Washington, unless otherwise required by local law.

#### 13. Updates to These Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we’ll notify you (for example, via the app or email). Continued use of the Service after changes means you accept the new Terms.

#### 14. Privacy
Your privacy matters to us. Please review our [Privacy Policy](/docs/privacy-policy/) for details on what personal data we collect, how we use it, and your rights and choices. By using the Service, you consent to our data practices as described in the Privacy Policy.
We are committed to protecting your personal information and will not sell your data. We only share data with third parties as necessary to operate the Service (e.g., payment processors, analytics, or customer support tools).

#### 15. App Store and Platform Terms
Our mobile applications are available through the Apple App Store and Google Play. You must also comply with the terms and conditions of those platforms, including their billing practices and policies.
Ohana Sports is solely responsible for the content of the app and support services. Neither Apple nor Google has any obligation to provide support or address claims related to the Service.
If you downloaded the app via Apple’s App Store:
- You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and Ohana Sports, not Apple.
- Apple is not responsible for any claims regarding the app, including product liability or legal compliance.

#### 16. Athletic Performance and Injury Disclaimer
The Ohana Sports Service is designed to support training, motivation, and athletic development. However, we are not a substitute for professional medical advice, personal coaching, or supervision.
You use the Service at your own risk. You acknowledge that physical activity carries inherent risks, including the risk of injury, and you agree that you are solely responsible for ensuring you are physically able to participate in any drills, exercises, or activities recommended or suggested by the Service.
If you feel discomfort or pain, stop immediately and seek medical attention. Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have any pre-existing conditions.
Ohana Sports is not liable for any injuries, health issues, or damages resulting from your use of the Service.

#### 17. Third-Party Equipment Disclaimer
The Kai Module is designed by Ohana Sports Tech LLC to interface with certain models of tennis ball machines manufactured by MetalTek, including those sold under the PlayMate® brand. Ohana Sports is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by MetalTek or PlayMate®. All trademarks referenced are the property of their respective owners and are used for descriptive purposes only.
We have made every reasonable effort to ensure that the Kai Module is compatible with supported PlayMate® machines in a manner consistent with MetalTek’s original design. However, the Kai Module is an independent aftermarket product, and Ohana Sports does not guarantee performance or compatibility with all machine configurations or conditions.
By using the Kai Module with a PlayMate® machine or any other third-party equipment, you acknowledge and agree that Ohana Sports is not responsible for any damage, malfunction, loss of warranty coverage, or other issues that may arise, directly or indirectly, in connection with such use. You assume all risks associated with connecting and operating third-party hardware in conjunction with the Kai Module.

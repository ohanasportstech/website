Kai makes your training sessions smarter, easier, and more
fun. Whether you‚Äôre running drills, customizing shots, or building your
own custom drills, this guide walks you through everything you need to
know.

<br>

## **Getting Started**

#### **Install the App**

Download **Kai - Tennis Training** to your phone from the iOS App Store or Google Play.

  drills, track progress, and manage your subscription. You can use your
  email, Google account, or Apple ID.

- **Pick your skill level**: This helps Kai to recommend drills tailored
  to your game.

  what hand you play with so a forehand is always a forehand and

all the main sections of the app:

üè† **Home Tab**

## **Connecting to Your Ball Machine**

To control a ball machine, Kai requires the **Kai Module**. This
is a Bluetooth receiver that can be plugged into supported PlayMate ball
machines.

- You can purchase your own Kai Module, or your club may already provide
  one that is plugged into the machine or available at the front desk.

- Without the Kai Module, Kai cannot control a PlayMate ball machine.

- The Kai Module will be available for purchase in **2026**.  
  üëâ [Visit this page](/pages/kai-module/) for more details.

<br>
#### **Supported Machines**

Currently, the Kai Module works with:

- **PlayMate iGenie** (recommended for full functionality and advanced
  drills)

- **PlayMate Ace** (supported for simpler feeds and remote control, but
  with limited drill options)

<br>

#### **Setup & Power**

- Plug the Kai Module into the **jack next to the power switch** on a
  supported PlayMate machine, using the provided cable.

- Turn on your ball machine.

- The Kai Module will power on automatically. Its LED will **blink
  red**, indicating it‚Äôs ready to connect.

<br>

### **Connection Process**

- The Kai app uses **Bluetooth Low Energy** to maximize your phone's battery life and ensure a smooth connection. No
  manual pairing is required.

- Simply open the app, and it will automatically search for and connect
  to a nearby Kai Module.

- The range is about **30 meters**, so you can connect from anywhere on
  the court.

<br>

#### **Connection Status**

- **Blinking red LED**: Kai Module is ready to connect.

- **Solid red LED**: Kai Module is successfully connected to the app.

- In the app:

  - The **Start button** on the drill page will be **blue** if
    connected.

  - If not connected, it will display "Searching..."

  - You can also check status by clicking on the User Tile at the top
    right.

‚ö†Ô∏è Only **one phone** can connect to a Kai Module at a time. If someone
else is connected, you won‚Äôt be able to take control until they shut down
their app.

<br>

#### **Troubleshooting Your Connection**

If you can‚Äôt connect, try these steps:

1.  **Check the hardware**

    - Make sure the Kai Module is properly plugged into the PlayMate
        machine.

    - Verify the ball machine is powered on.

    - If the LED is off ‚Üí Module is not receiving power.

    - If the LED is solid red ‚Üí Another phone is already connected.

2.  **Check app permissions**

    - Ensure you granted the Kai app permission to use **Bluetooth**
        during setup.

    - If not, go to your phone‚Äôs **Settings ‚Üí Kai App ‚Üí Permissions**,
        and enable Bluetooth.

3.  **Check in-app status**

    - Open any drill page.

    - If connected, the **Start button** will be blue.

    - If not, it will display ‚ÄúSearching...‚Äù

4.  **Still stuck?**

    - Restart the ball machine.

    - Close and reopen the Kai app.

    - Make sure no other phone nearby is currently connected.

start training.

## **Drills**

Drills are the heart of **Kai - Tennis Training**. They‚Äôre organized into two main groups so you can groove consistency or practice real match scenarios.

#### **Rhythm and Reps (Simple Patterns)**

These drills mimic a coach feeding balls to help you build reliable
mechanics through repetition.

- **Pick a shot to work on**. E.g. ground stroke, volley, overheads.

- **Select Type of Feed**: Forehand, backhand, alternating, etc.

- **Buddy Practice**: This category is designed for two players to share
  the machine. Feeds are sped up, so players alternate quickly and
  maximize reps.

#### **Tactical Point Play (Match Scenarios)**

Pattern-based drills that simulate situations you‚Äôll face in real
singles or doubles play.

- **Approach & Finish**: deep ball ‚Üí neutral ball ‚Üí volley, with
  recovery time built in.

- **Cardio Movement & Footwork**: side-to-side and forward/back movement
  to train hitting on the run, balance, and endurance.

- **Doubles Situations**: practice alone or with your partner in drills
  that reflect common doubles points.

These advanced patterns unlock the next level of ball machine training
and directly improve your match play. They are included with the Premium
Subscription, and will be updated and expanded regularly.

<br>

#### **Drill Start Page**

Once you've decided what to work on, you'll see drill details and tips and can set
session options before starting.

**3D Visualization**  
At the top of the page is a 3D animation that shows you how the drill works. 
Spin the animation with your finger to view the drill from different angles.

**Quick Controls**  
Quick controls allow you to set session options.

- **‚è± Duration** ‚Äî set drill length in minutes. The drill will stop
  automatically when the time runs out. If not set, the duration is
  unlimited and the ball machine will run till you stop it or the hopper
  is empty.

- **üîÄ Shuffle** ‚Äî randomize the shot order. This helps you work on reaction times and readiness. Shuffle is only
  available on selected drills.

- **‚ù§Ô∏è Favorite** ‚Äî save drills in the Home tab so you can quickly access them later.

**Level Selector**  
Choose Easy, Medium, Hard, or Advanced. Adjust before starting or while
the drill is running ‚Äî the ball machine adapts instantly.

- *Easy*: slower, lighter spin, higher net clearance.

- *Medium*: standard pace/spin.

- *Hard*: faster pace, heavier spin, lower net clearance.

- *Advanced*: most challenging feeds for advanced players.

This allows you to warm up easy, then raise the challenge as you go.

<br>
<br>

## **Shot Studio**

The Shot Studio is where you can focus on **single-shot feeds**.

#### **Shot Selection**

- **Pick a shot type** ‚Äì ground stroke, warm-up, volley, etc.

- **Choose the direction** ‚Äì down the middle, left, right.

- **Set the level** ‚Äì easy, medium, hard, advanced.

  time. One-ball feeds are perfect for coaches running lessons.

in shot details just like you would on the ball machine itself.

### Early Access: Free Through 2025

Right now, **Kai is completely free to use**.  

We invite everyone who belongs to a participating tennis club in the Pacific Northwest to try Kai, train with our drills, and give feedback - tell us what you think!

Starting in 2026, we will be introducing subscription plans to help us continue building something truly special and support our community.

- **New pro designed drills** to continuously update our library with fresh, high-quality training content.  
- **App enhancements** with new features and better ways to help you reach your tennis goals.
- **Smarter tools** for coaches, pros, and everyone in the community to create and share custom drills.

## What to Expect

When we launch subscriptions in 2026, we’ll offer **a few simple, flexible tiers** to match different players’ needs:

- **Essentials** – For players who use a ball machine occasionally and want a super easy way to start and stop basic drills.  
- **Premium** – For players ready to push their game further with rally-style simulations, advanced drills, and skill-focused training.  
- **Pro** – For coaches, parents, and team captains who want to create custom training plans, assign drills, and share them with students, children, or teammates.

As we get closer to launch, we’ll share **full details on pricing, features, and plans** so you can choose the best fit.

**Effective Date:** July 2nd, 2025  

Ohana Sports ("we", "us", or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how we collect, use, and share data. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our mobile application ("the App") available on iOS and Android platforms, and our related services (collectively, the “Services”).

By creating an account or using our Services, you agree to this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Use](https://www.ohanasports.net/docs/terms-of-use/). If you do not agree, do not use the App.

#### 1. Information We Collect
We collect non-personally identifiable data (“non-PII”) to operate and improve our Services. This includes:

**a. Telemetry and Usage Data**

Collected automatically via tools like MixPanel, and may include:
- Features or drills accessed
- Session frequency and duration
- Navigation patterns
- Crashes and performance data
- Device type, OS version, and app version
- Approximate location (based on IP address)

**b. Account Information**

To use the app, you must create an account. During this process, we may collect:
- A username or identifier (this can be anonymized)
- Authentication tokens

We do not collect or retain personal data such as full names, addresses, email addresses, or any directly identifying information unless required for authentication purposes—and even then, such data is minimized and may be anonymized or hashed.

#### 2. How We Use Your Information
We use the collected information to:
- Analyze app usage and trends
- Improve features, drills, and performance
- Fix bugs and technical issues
- Understand regional usage patterns
- Ensure app security and reliability

All data collected through Mixpanel is anonymized or pseudonymized and used only in aggregate form.

#### 3. Use of Mixpanel
We use Mixpanel, a third-party analytics service, to help us understand how users engage with the App. Mixpanel uses cookies or mobile identifiers to collect and process usage data.

To learn more about how Mixpanel handles your data, visit https://mixpanel.com/legal/privacy-policy/. You can opt out of Mixpanel tracking by following the instructions at [https://mixpanel.com/optout/](https://mixpanel.com/optout/).

#### 4. Data Sharing
We do not sell your data. We may share anonymized data with trusted service providers under contractual obligations for purposes such as analytics, infrastructure hosting, or crash reporting.

We may disclose data if required by law or if necessary to protect rights, safety, or legal obligations.

**a. User-Shared Drills and Playlists**

The App allows users to share custom drills and playlists via a publicly accessible link. When you share a drill or playlist, the associated data—including drill names, notes, and configurations—becomes available to anyone who accesses the link.
Ohana Sports does not restrict or monitor who accesses such links. We advise users not to include personally identifiable or sensitive information in shared drills or playlists.
You can make a shared drill or playlist private again at any time, which disables the public link and prevents further access to that data.

#### 5. Your Rights and Choices
**a. GDPR (European Economic Area residents)**

If you are a resident of the EEA, you have the right to:
- Access the data we collect about you
- Request corrections or deletions of your data
- Object to or restrict certain processing activities
- File a complaint with your local data protection authority

You can request any of the above by contacting us at support@ohanasports.net or by submitting a request via our [Data Deletion Request](/pages/data-deletion/) page. We will respond within 30 days.

**b. CCPA/CPRA (California residents)**

If you are a California resident, you have the right to:
- Know what categories of data we collect and why
- Request deletion of your data
- Opt out of the sale or sharing of your personal data (we do neither)

To exercise your rights, email us at support@ohanasports.net with “California Privacy Request” in the subject line. You may also submit a deletion request via our [Data Deletion Request](/pages/data-deletion/) page.

#### 6. Data Retention
We retain anonymized usage and diagnostic data for as long as needed to provide and improve the Services, unless otherwise required by law or legal obligation.

#### 7. Data Security
We use industry-standard measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.

#### 8. Children’s Privacy
Our Services are not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we become aware of such data, we will delete it promptly.

#### 9. Acceptance Through Account Creation
When you create an account and use the App, you confirm that you have read and agree to both this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. You will be presented with a clear notice and link during the account creation process.

#### 10. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the law or our practices. We will notify you through the App or other appropriate channels. The most current version will always be available at https://www.ohanasports.net/docs/privacy-policy/.
